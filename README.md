# 2D-permafrost-model

# What is 2D-permafrost-model

A two-dimensional heat conduction model with phase change is used to simulate the thermal state of permafrost. 

# Why this model is Powerful 
(1)The model is two-dimensional

(2)Consider the influence of phase change

(3)Consider the influence of lateral heat flux

(4)Irregular terrain can be used

(5)Provides a soil parameterization scheme

# How to Run
2D-permafrost-model is wrotten by Matlab and public open. To run the software, please

(1) Get model code at https://github.com/s898657703/2D-permafrost-model/edit/main/README.mdhttps://github.com/geocryology/REDCAPP

(2) Run the script

(3) Explore the results. 

(4) Customise the code and use it for your project.
